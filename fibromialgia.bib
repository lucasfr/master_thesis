abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome is mainly characterized by pain, fatigue, and sleep disruption. The etiology of fibromyalgia is still unclear: if central sensitization is considered to be the main mechanism involved, then many other factors, genetic, immunological, and hormonal, may play an important role. The diagnosis is typically clinical (there are no laboratory abnormalities) and the physician must concentrate on pain and on its features. Additional symptoms (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon, irritable bowel disease, and heat and cold intolerance) can be associated with this condition. A careful differential diagnosis is mandatory: fibromyalgia is not a diagnosis of exclusion. Since 1990, diagnosis has been principally based on the two major diagnostic criteria defined by the ACR. Recently, new criteria have been proposed. The main goals of the treatment are to alleviate pain, increase restorative sleep, and improve physical function. A multidisciplinary approach is optimal. While most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have limited benefit, an important role is played by antidepressants and neuromodulating antiepileptics: currently duloxetine (NNT for a 30\% pain reduction 7.2), milnacipran (NNT 19), and pregabalin (NNT 8.6) are the only drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments should be associated with drug therapy.},

abstract = {With the mounting realization that variability is an inevitable part of human behavior comes the need to integrate this phenomenon in concomitant models and theories of motor control. Among other things, this has resulted in a debate throughout the last decades about the origin of variability in behavior, the outcome of which has important implications for motor control theories. To date, a monofractal formalism of variability has been used as the basis for arguing for component- versus interaction-oriented theories of motor control. However, monofractal formalism alone cannot decide between the opposing sides of the debate. The present theoretical overview introduces multifractal formalisms as a necessary extension of the conventional monofractal formalism. In multifractal formalisms, the scale invariance of behavior is numerically defined as a spectrum of scaling exponents, rather than a single average exponent as in the monofractal formalism. Several methods to estimate the multifractal spectrum of scaling exponents - all within two multifractal formalisms called large deviation and Legendre formalism - are introduced and briefly discussed. Furthermore, the multifractal analyses within these two formalisms are applied to several performance tasks to illustrate how explanations of motor control vary with the methods used. The main section of the theoretical overview discusses the implications of multifractal extensions of the component- and interaction-oriented models for existing theories of motor control.

Although the interaction between chronic pain and physical functioning is a well-accepted paradigm in clinical research, the understanding of how pain affects individuals' daily life behavior remains a challenging task. Here we develop a methodological framework allowing to objectively document disruptive pain related interferences on real-life physical activity. The results reveal that meaningful information is contained in the temporal dynamics of activity patterns and an analytical model based on the theory of bivariate point processes can be used to describe physical activity behavior. The model parameters capture the dynamic interdependence between periods and events and determine a 'signature' of activity pattern. The study is likely to contribute to the clinical understanding of complex pain/disease-related behaviors and establish a unified mathematical framework to quantify the complex dynamics of various human activities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern theories define chronic pain as a multidimensional experience - the result of complex interplay between physiological and psychological factors with significant impact on patients' physical, emotional and social functioning. The development of reliable assessment tools capable of capturing the multidimensional impact of chronic pain has challenged the medical community for decades. A number of validated tools are currently used in clinical practice however they all rely on self-reporting and are therefore inherently subjective. In this study we show that a comprehensive analysis of physical activity (PA) under real life conditions may capture behavioral aspects that may reflect physical and emotional functioning.

METHODOLOGY: PA was monitored during five consecutive days in 60 chronic pain patients and 15 pain-free healthy subjects. To analyze the various aspects of pain-related activity behaviors we defined the concept of PA 'barcoding'. The main idea was to combine different features of PA (type, intensity, duration) to define various PA states. The temporal sequence of different states was visualized as a 'barcode' which indicated that significant information about daily activity can be contained in the amount and variety of PA states, and in the temporal structure of sequence. This information was quantified using complementary measures such as structural complexity metrics (information and sample entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity), time spent in PA states, and two composite scores, which integrate all measures. The reliability of these measures to characterize chronic pain conditions was assessed by comparing groups of subjects with clinically different pain intensity.

CONCLUSION: The defined measures of PA showed good discriminative features. The results suggest that significant information about pain-related functional limitations is captured by the structural complexity of PA barcodes, which decreases when the intensity of pain increases. We conclude that a comprehensive analysis of daily-life PA can provide an objective appraisal of the intensity of pain.},

abstract = {Even under healthy, basal conditions, physiologic systems show erratic fluctuations resembling those found in dynamical systems driven away from a single equilibrium state. Do such "nonequilibrium" fluctuations simply reflect the fact that physiologic systems are being constantly perturbed by external and intrinsic noise? Or, do these fluctuations actually, contain useful, "hidden" information about the underlying nonequilibrium control mechanisms? We report some recent attempts to understand the dynamics of complex physiologic fluctuations by adapting and extending concepts and methods developed very recently in statistical physics. Specifically, we focus on interbeat interval variability as an important quantity to help elucidate possibly non-homeostatic physiologic variability because (i) the heart rate is under direct neuroautonomic control, (ii) interbeat interval variability is readily measured by noninvasive means, and (iii) analysis of these heart rate dynamics may provide important practical diagnostic and prognostic information not obtainable with current approaches. The analytic tools we discuss may be used on a wider range of physiologic signals. We first review recent progress using two analysis methods--detrended fluctuation analysis and wavelets--sufficient for quantifying monofractual structures. We then describe recent work that quantifies multifractal features of interbeat interval series, and the discovery that the multifractal structure of healthy subjects is different than that of diseased subjects.},

abstract = {Although patients with chronic pain are often considered to have reduced levels of everyday physical activity, data on their activity levels are scarce and inconclusive. Therefore, this study explored whether patients with chronic pain have reduced activity levels, as objectively measured with an activity monitor. The activity monitor is based on long-term ambulatory monitoring of signals from body-fixed accelerometers during everyday life, aimed at assessment of mobility-related activities. Measurements with the monitor were performed during a weekday (24 h) in 18 patients with chronic pain and compared with measurements obtained from 18 gender and age matched healthy comparison subjects. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 44 (11) years, and the mean (SD) duration of their complaints was 8 (7) years. Compared with the healthy subjects, the duration of dynamic activities was not significantly reduced (p=0.10) in the patient group. Mean (SD) intensity of everyday physical activity was lower (p=0.03) in the patients than in the healthy comparison subjects (0.021 [0.006] g versus 0.026 [0.004] g), and patients spent more time lying down (47.0 [10.2]\% versus 34.3 [5.6] \%; p=0.000) and less time sitting (29.2 [8.9]\% versus 36.4 [9.3]\%; p=0.03) than the healthy comparison subjects. In spite of significant differences between patients and healthy comparison subjects for some aspects of the activity pattern (which may reflect pain behaviour), the impact of chronic pain on everyday physical activity was relatively small.},

abstract = {The capacity of self-organized systems to adapt is embodied in the functional organization of intrinsic control mechanisms. Evolution in functional complexity of heart rate variability (HRV) was used as measure of the capacity of the transplanted heart to express newly emergent regulatory order. In a cross-sectional study of 100 patients after (0-10 yr) heart transplantation (HTX), heart rate dynamics were assessed using pointwise correlation dimension (PD2) analysis. A new observation is that, commencing with the acute event of allograft transplantation, the dynamics of rhythm formation proceed through complex phase transitions. At implantation, the donor heart manifested metronome-like chronotropic behavior (PD2 approximately 1.0). At 11-100 days, dimensional complexity of HRV reached a peak (PD2 approximately 2.0) associated with resurgence in the high-frequency component (0.15-0.5 Hz) of the power spectral density. Subsequent dimensional loss to PD2 approximately 1.0 at 20-30 mo after HTX was followed by a progressive near-linear gain in system complexity, reaching PD2 approximately 3.0 7-10 yr after HTX. The "dynamic reorganization" in the allograft rhythm-generating system, seen in the first 100 days, is a manifestation of the adaptive capacity of intrinsic control mechanisms. The loss of HRV 2 yr after HTX implies a withdrawal of intrinsic autonomic control and/or development of an entrained dynamic pattern characteristic of extrinsic sympathetic input. The subsequent long-term progressive rise in dimensional complexity of HRV can be attributed to the restoration of a functional order patterning parasympathetic control. The recognition that the decentralized heart can restitute the multidimensional state space of HR generator dynamics independent of external autonomic signaling may provide a new perspective on principles that constitute homeodynamic regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trigger mechanisms for the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients without structural heart disease are not well established. New analysis methods of heart rate (HR) variability based on nonlinear system theory may reveal features and abnormalities in R-R interval behavior that are not detectable by traditional analysis methods. The purpose of this study was to reveal possible alterations in the dynamics of R-R intervals before the spontaneous onset of paroxysmal AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Traditional time and frequency domain HR variability indices, along with the short-term scaling exponent alpha(1) and approximate entropy (ApEn), were analyzed in 20-minute intervals before 92 episodes of spontaneous, paroxysmal AF in 22 patients without structural heart disease. Traditional HR variability measures showed no significant changes before the onset of AF. A progressive decrease occurred both in ApEn (1.09+/-0.26 120 to 100 minutes before AF; 0.88+/-0.24 20 to 0 minutes before AF; P<0.001) and in alpha(1) (1.01+/-0.28 120 to 100 minutes before AF, 0.89+/-0.28 20 to 0 minutes before AF; P<0.05) before the AF episodes. Both ApEn (0. 89+/-0.27 versus 1.02+/-0.30; P<0.05) and alpha(1) (0.91+/-0.28 versus 1.27+/-0.21; P<0.001) were also lower before the onset of AF compared with values obtained from matched healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the complexity of R-R intervals and altered fractal properties in short-term R-R interval dynamics precede the spontaneous onset of AF in patients with no structural heart disease. Further studies are needed to determine the physiological correlates of these new, nonlinear HR variability measures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether fibromyalgia (FM) patients differ from matched healthy controls in clinical tests of balance ability and fall frequency. METHODS: Thirty-four FM patients and 32 age-matched controls were administered the Balance Evaluation-Systems Test (BESTest), rated their balance confidence with the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, and reported the number of falls in the last 6 months. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire was used to assess FM severity. RESULTS: FM patients had significantly impaired balance in all components of the BESTest compared with controls. They also scored more poorly on balance confidence. Overall FM severity (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire) correlated significantly with the BESTest and the ABC scale. The BESTest and ABC correlated significantly with 6 commonly reported FM symptoms (excluding pain). FM patients reported a total of 37 falls over the last 6-months compared with 6 falls in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: FM is associated with balance problems and increased fall frequency. Patients were aware of their balance problems. These results suggest that FM may affect peripheral and/or central mechanisms of postural control. Further objective study is needed to identify the relative contributions of various neural and musculoskeletal and other impairments to postural stability in FM to provide clinicians with methods to maximize postural stability and help fall prevention.},

Data used for this study included women (n = 1,735) aged 31-78 years who reported being diagnosed with FM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: More than 25\% of women reported having difficulty taking care of personal needs and bathing, and >60\% reported difficulty doing light household tasks, going up/down 1 flight of stairs, walking (1/2) mile, and lifting or carrying 10 lbs. More than 90\% of women reported having difficulty doing heavy household tasks, lifting or carrying 25 lbs, and doing strenuous activities. Women with lower functional ability reported higher levels of fatigue, pain, spasticity, depression, restless legs, balance problems, dizziness, fear of falling, and bladder problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The average woman in this sample reported having less functional ability related to activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living than the average community-dwelling woman in her 80s. Several symptoms/conditions were found to be associated with functional limitation in women with FM. Targeting these-singly or in clusters-may potentially be important in terms of future interventions.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Understanding individual differences in the variability of fibromyalgia pain can help elucidate etiological mechanisms and treatment targets. Past research has shown that spatial extent of pain, negative mood, and aftersensation (pain ratings taken after experimental induction of pain) accounts for 40 to 50\% of the variance in clinical pain. Poor sleep is hypothesized to have a reciprocal relationship with pain, and over 75\% of individuals with fibromyalgia report disturbed sleep. We hypothesized that measures of sleep would increase the predictive ability of the clinical pain model. Measures of usual pain, spatial extent of pain, negative mood, and pain aftersensation were taken from 74 adults with fibromyalgia. Objective (actigraph) and subjective (diary) measures of sleep duration and nightly wake time were also obtained from the participants over 14 days. Hierarchical regression indicated that greater spatial extent (R(2) = .26), higher aftersensation ratings (R(2) = .06), and higher negative mood (R(2) = .04) accounted for 36\% of the variance in clinical pain (average of 14 daily pain ratings). None of the sleep variables were significant predictors of clinical pain. Results replicate previous research and suggest that spatial extent of pain, pain aftersensation, and negative mood play important roles in clinical pain, but sleep disturbance did not aid in its prediction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPERSPECTIVE: This study suggests that measures of sleep duration and nightly wake time do not predict fibromyalgia pain at the group level. Fibromyalgia patients may benefit from a 3-pronged approach to pain management: reducing pain's spatial extent, normalization of central nervous system hypersensitivity, and psychobehavioral therapies for negative mood.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the concordance between the subjective and objective methods of sleep assessment in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and to delineate factors associated with discrepancy between the 2 sleep assessment methods. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with FMS completed a 7-day home assessment protocol. They wore an actigraphic device at all times. In the morning, they used the electronic diary to record the subjective report of sleep from the previous night and current severity of the FMS-related symptoms. RESULTS: On average, the 2 assessment methods yielded a 73 absolute minute difference per night per patient. About half of the nights, sleep duration was underestimated. Approximately 20\% of the nights had greater than 2-hour difference between the 2 methods. Factors related to this large discrepancy were (1) objective indicator of restless sleep, (2) subjective report of difficulty falling asleep, and (3) report of fatigue at the time of reporting. FMS-related symptoms were related to subjective report of poor sleep but not to objective sleep data. DISCUSSION: Misestimation of sleep seems common in FMS patients, particularly when their sleep quality is poor. Careful considerations for evaluating the severity of patients' sleep complaints are critical in adequate management of sleep disturbance that is commonly reported by FMS patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain condition that is associated with reduced physical function. Recent research has demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving daily functioning among adolescents with JFM. However, it is not known whether these improvements were accompanied by increased physical activity levels. Our objective was to analyze secondary data from a randomized clinical trial of CBT to examine whether CBT was associated with improvement in objectively measured physical activity and whether actigraphy indices corresponded with self-reported functioning among adolescents with JFM. METHODS: Participants were 114 adolescents (ages 11-18 years) recruited from pediatric rheumatology clinics that met criteria for JFM and were enrolled in a clinical trial. Subjects were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either CBT or fibromyalgia education (FE). Participants wore a hip-mounted accelerometer for 1 week as part of their baseline and posttreatment assessments. RESULTS: The final sample included 68 subjects (94\% female, mean age 15.2 years) for whom complete actigraphy data were obtained. Actigraphy measures were not found to correspond with self-reported improvements in functioning. While self-reported functioning improved in the CBT condition compared to FE, no significant changes were seen in either group for activity counts, sedentary, moderate, or vigorous activity. The CBT group had significantly lower peak and light activity at posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Actigraphy monitoring provides a unique source of information about patient outcomes. CBT intervention was not associated with increased physical activity in adolescents with JFM, indicating that combining CBT with interventions to increase physical activity may enhance treatment effects.},

In order to assess the accuracy of the technique, we calculate the exponent H(t) for artificial series, simulating monofractal Brownian paths, with assigned Hurst exponents H. We next calculate the exponent H(t) for the return of high-frequency (tick-by-tick sampled every minute) series of the German market. We find a much more pronounced time-variability in the local scaling exponent of financial series compared to the artificial ones. The DMA algorithm allows the calculation of the exponent H(t), without any a priori assumption on the stochastic process and on the probability distribution function of the random variables, as happens, for example, in the case of the Kitagawa grid and the extended Kalmann filtering methods. The present technique examines the local scaling exponent H(t) around a given instant of time. This is a significant advance with respect to the standard wavelet transform or to the higher-order power spectrum technique, which instead operate on the global properties of the series by Legendre or Fourier transform of qth-order moments.

abstract = {Multifractal analysis is now increasingly used to characterize soil properties as it may provide more information than a single fractal model. During the building of a large reservoir on the Parana River (Brazil), a highly weathered soil profile was excavated to a depth between 5 and 8 m. Excavation resulted in an abandoned area with saprolite materials and, in this area, an experimental field was established to assess the effectiveness of different soil rehabilitation treatments. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks. The aim of this work was to characterize particle-size distributions of the saprolite material and use the information obtained to assess between-block variability. Particle-size distributions of the experimental plots were characterized by multifractal techniques. Ninety-six soil samples were analyzed routinely for particle-size distribution by laser diffractometry in a range of scales, varying from 0.390 to 2000 $\mu$m. Six different textural classes (USDA) were identified with a clay content ranging from 16.9\% to 58.4\%. Multifractal models described reasonably well the scaling properties of particle-size distributions of the saprolite material. This material exhibits a high entropy dimension, D1. Parameters derived from the left side (q > 0) of the f($\alpha$) spectra, D1, the correlation dimension (D2) and the range ($\alpha$0 - $\alpha$q+), as well as the total width of the spectra ($\alpha$max - $\alpha$min), all showed dependence on the clay content. Sand, silt and clay contents were significantly different among treatments as a consequence of soil intrinsic variability. The D1 and the Holder exponent of order zero, $\alpha$0, were not significantly different between treatments; in contrast, D2 and several fractal attributes describing the width of the f($\alpha$) spectra were significantly different between treatments. The only parameter showing significant differences between sampling depths was ($\alpha$0 - $\alpha$q+). Scale independent fractal attributes may be useful for characterizing intrinsic particle-size distribution variability. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We find that the successive increments in the cardiac beat-to-beat intervals of healthy subjects display scale-invariant, long-range anticorrelations (up to 10(4) heart beats).  Furthermore, we find that the histogram for the heartbeat intervals increments is well described by a L\'{e}vy stable distribution.  For a group of subjects with severe heart disease, we find that the distribution is unchanged, but the long-range correlations vanish.  Therefore, the different scaling behavior in health and disease must relate to the underlying dynamics of the heartbeat.},

@article{Hu2009,
abstract = {Human motor control systems orchestrate complex scale-invariant patterns of activity over a wide range of time scales (minutes to hours). The neural mechanisms underlying scale-invariance are unknown in humans. In rats, the master circadian pacemaker [suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)] is crucially involved in scale-invariant activity fluctuations over multiple time scales from minutes to 24 h. Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with progressive dysfunction of the SCN. Thus, if the SCN is responsible for the scale-invariant activity fluctuations in humans, we predict disturbances of scale-invariant activity fluctuations in elderly humans and even more pronounced disturbances in elderly humans with AD. To test these hypotheses, we studied spontaneous daytime activity patterns in 13 young adults (mean +/- SD: 25.5 +/- 6.1 y); 13 elderly people with early-stage AD (68.5 +/- 6.1 y) matched with 13 elderly controls (68.6 +/- 6.1 y); and 14 very old people with late-stage AD (83.9 +/- 6.7 y) matched with 12 very old controls (80.8 +/- 8.6 y). In young adults, activity exhibited robust scale-invariant correlations across all tested time scales (minutes to 8 h). The scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h declined with age (P = 0.01) and were significantly reduced in the elderly (P = 0.04) and very old controls (P = 0.02). Remarkably, an age-independent AD effect further reduced the scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h (P = 0.04), leading to the greatest reduction of the scale-invariant correlations in very old people with late-stage AD-resembling closely the loss of correlations at large time scales in SCN-lesioned animals. Thus, aging and AD significantly attenuate the scale invariance of activity fluctuations over multiple time scales. This attenuation may reflect functional changes of the SCN.},

@article{Natarajan2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a representative signal containing information about the condition of the brain. The shape of the wave may contain useful information about the state of the brain. However, the human observer can not directly monitor these subtle details. Besides, since bio-signals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, the EEG signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. This work discusses the effect on the EEG signal due to music and reflexological stimulation. METHODS: In this work, nonlinear parameters like Correlation Dimension (CD), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Hurst Exponent (H) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn) are evaluated from the EEG signals under different mental states. RESULTS: The results obtained show that EEG to become less complex relative to the normal state with a confidence level of more than 85\% due to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: It is found that the measures are significantly lower when the subjects are under sound or reflexologic stimulation as compared to the normal state. The dimension increases with the degree of the cognitive activity. This suggests that when the subjects are under sound or reflexologic stimuli, the number of parallel functional processes active in the brain is less and the brain goes to a more relaxed state},

@article{Zheng2005,
abstract = {Understanding neuronal firing patterns is one of the most important problems in theoretical neuroscience. It is also very important for clinical neurosurgery. In this Letter, we introduce a computational procedure to examine whether neuronal firing recordings could be characterized by cascade multiplicative multifractals. By analyzing raw recording data as well as generated spike train data from 3 patients collected in two brain areas, the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and the globus pallidus interna (GPi), we show that the neural firings are consistent with a multifractal process over certain time scale range (t1,t2), where t1 is argued to be not smaller than the mean inter-spike-interval of neuronal firings, while t2 may be related to the time that neuronal signals propagate in the major neural branching structures pertinent to GPi and GPe. The generalized dimension spectrum Dq effectively differentiates the two brain areas, both intra- and inter-patients. For distinguishing between GPe and GPi, it is further shown that the cascade model is more effective than the methods recently examined by Schiff et al. as well as the Fano factor analysis. Therefore, the methodology may be useful in developing computer aided tools to help clinicians perform precision neurosurgery in the operating room. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
